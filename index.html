          <p>
            I finished my Computer Science studies and earned a title of an
            Engineer at the end of January 2022. I graduated from Wrocław
            University of Science and Technology where I studied for over 3
            years. During that time I found out that programming can be really
            entertaining and it can change our lives for better. This is why I
            would like to continue this journey and learn even more.

          <h3 class="background-story-title">Software Engineer</h3>
          <p>
            I got interested in software engineering during my studies. Before I
            learned about the role of a Software Engineer I thought programming
            is just writing code and hoping it will run as planned. The
            craftmanship of a good Software Enginner ensures that projects will
            be finished on time and the quality of the provided solution will be
            more than just acceptable. My goal is to constantly hone my skills
            as a Software Enginner.

          <h3 class="background-story-title">Fullstack Developer</h3>
          <p>
            When I was working in group projects I was always the one
            responsible for the backend of the application but I always felt
            like this is not enough. I did not like being so strongly dependent
            on other people and not being able to help them. This is why I got
            interested in learning more about the frontend technologies (mainly
            related to Javascript) to become a true fullstack developer in the
            nearest future.

        <p>
          In a work and in less formal environments I can describe myselsf as an
          open and communicative person. I like working in groups and I am a
          very good teammate because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I am a good listener</li>
          <li>I express my thoughts clearly</li>
          <li>I always keep my promises</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On every day basis I tend to be very responsible and meticulous and
          this is also how I work. I consider myself a reliable person whose
          can-do attitude helps to overcome everyday struggles.

          I prefer to work with:

        <p class="hard-text-2">I am a fast learner and I constantly want to improve.
          I have no problems with learning new skills because I find studying truly exciting.
          During my CS studies I had contact with many technologies that were fairly new to me and I had no problems
          with passing all my exams with flying colors. <span>&#128522</span></p>
